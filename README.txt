Project developed in Matlab, implementing Bilateral Filtering for the Advanced Image Analysis module. Can be used both for Grayscale and RGB images.

The function for grayscale images is named "bilateralGrayscale" and an example of how to use it is given in the comments of the function. The PSNR is also computed.

For the RGB images the file named "bilateralRGB" can be used. The same process is followed for every one of the three channels.

The images can be found in the issue created called Images
